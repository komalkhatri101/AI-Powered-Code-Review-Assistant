Simple Code Reviewer
A beginner-friendly Python tool that performs automated code reviews on Python functions.

Features
Checks code style and formatting: Ensures adherence to PEP 8 guidelines.

Detects common bugs and anti-patterns: Identifies potential issues like redundant code and deeply nested loops.

Enforces naming conventions: Ensures variable and function names are clear and consistent.

Analyzes code complexity: Suggests improvements for functions that are too complex.

Provides clear feedback with suggestions for improvement: Helps developers improve their code quality with actionable suggestions.

Overview
This project is designed to automate the process of code review for Python code using a tool that integrates with GitHub. The goal is to speed up the review process by leveraging an automated assistant that can:

Analyze code quality based on predefined standards.

Detect common bugs and code anti-patterns.

Enforce coding practices such as naming conventions and code complexity.

Provide clear feedback with actionable suggestions for improvement.

In addition to these capabilities, the system is integrated with GitHub so that it automatically reviews code on pull requests (PRs) as they are created or updated. The feedback is posted directly in the form of comments on the PR, which helps developers understand potential issues in real-time.

Key Features and Functionality Implemented
1. Code Style and Formatting Check
The tool checks the Python code against PEP 8 guidelines, which is the standard coding style for Python.

It looks for issues like:

Indentation errors

Missing spaces

Improper use of brackets

2. Bug Detection and Anti-patterns
The code analyzer identifies:

Common bugs (e.g., undefined variables, redundant code)

Anti-patterns (e.g., deeply nested loops, unused variables)

It alerts developers when their code may result in errors or inefficiencies.

3. Naming Conventions Enforcement
The tool ensures that variable and function names adhere to established naming conventions.

It checks whether function names are descriptive.

It ensures variables follow a consistent naming pattern.

4. Code Complexity Analysis
The tool analyzes the complexity of functions and methods.

It suggests breaking down large, complex functions into smaller, more manageable ones to improve readability and maintainability.

5. GitHub Integration for Automated PR Review
The tool is integrated with GitHub using the GitHub API.

Every time a pull request (PR) is created or updated in a repository, the tool automatically:

Fetches the Python code in the PR.

Analyzes the code using the built-in reviewer.

Posts feedback as comments on the PR, so developers receive instant suggestions for improvement.

Usage
python
Copy
Edit
from simple_code_reviewer import SimpleCodeReviewer

# Initialize the reviewer
reviewer = SimpleCodeReviewer()

# Review the code
code = """
def example_function(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
"""
results = reviewer.review_code(code)

# Output the results
print(results)
This example shows how to use the SimpleCodeReviewer to review a small Python function. You can replace the code variable with any Python code that you want to review.

Conclusion
The Simple Code Reviewer tool helps automate the process of code review by checking Python code for common errors, style violations, and inefficiencies. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub, allowing for real-time feedback on pull requests. This improves the development process by reducing human errors, ensuring code quality, and speeding up the review process.
